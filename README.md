# random-sql-user-generator
It's was tedious for me to write out fake details for use in a database, so I wrote a quick script to output some fake details.
The results are then output to a .sql file.

### Requirements
* `Python 3.4`
* `Requests`

### Usage
To run the script use:
  `python usergenerator.py [count]`
where count is the number of fake details you want to generate.
